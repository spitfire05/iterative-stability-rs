# iterative-stability
The library for calculating fractals using iterative functions. Heavily WIP, recreational & learning project, don't blame me if the code you see here makes you do bad things ;)

## Features
* Iterative sets:
  - Julia
  - Mandelbrot
* Parallel computation with `parallel` feature (default)

## Examples
* `mandelbrot_minifb` - a crude, simple Mandelbrot set visualization with zooming using `minifb`

## TODO
* More or dynamic floating point precision in computations
* GPU-powered computation using `wgpu`
* More sophisticated examples, possibly using `pixels` crate and advanced zooming/translation for exploring the fractals
